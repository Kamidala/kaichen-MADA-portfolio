## Short Biography

I am a Master of Public Health (MPH) student with an emphasis in Epidemiology. I completed my undergraduate education at the University of Georgia (UGA) with a major in Biology before matriculating into the MPH program via the dual degree pathway offered (4+1). As a future public health professional who comes from a multicultural background and speaks three languages, I find the international stage to be very important to ongoing public health topics.

### Fun Fact

I very much enjoy foreign language musicals and have met some of my closest friends through a French musical it seems no one has ever heard of: Mozart L'Opera Rock.

## Goals for This Course

I hope to learn more in-depth techniques for data analysis and implement them in my current and future research. I am especially interested in how this class will approach machine learning, since it can be used with such versatility (and even [predict earthquake damage](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350630722009165?casa_token=_dfKkYa5rMIAAAAA:CnqtyZwzDqtjCCiVvSfZYrjP8x2ZVxP4r6pPn8RCduIZvWawqiX_G3QBVoqLoE1DHyHIlf09Mm3H)).

## Research Interests

My primary interest is in respiratory illness, especially infectious respiratory diseases. For this semester, I am participating in research on household air pollution while interning abroad in Guatemala (to analyze their surveillance data on respiratory disease).

## Training

I have attended two outbreak simulations hosted by UGA in the past, and I have also collected data on behalf of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2021. Previous research experiences and coursework have led to skills in JMP, SAS, and R.
