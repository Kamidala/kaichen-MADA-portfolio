# Source

The data for this exercise was obtained from the Harvard Dataverse - Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). This dataset was released in 2017 and contains "a nationally representative sample of 64,600 American adults" from 2016 [@ansolabehere2018]. A data dictionary/codebook was also available for view.

Because the original dataset was over 100 MB, a version with several variables removed was saved and used for this analysis. The original dataset can still be found and downloaded from the CCES site.

# Original Plot

![Graphical breakdown of voters for the two main political parties' primaries in the United States](data/original_visualization.png)

The data visualization first appeared on the site FiveThirtyEight in the article \*Why Democrats Struggle to Motivate a 'Religious Left'" [@thomson-deveaux2019].

# Recreation of Plot

## Load Libraries

```{r echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
```

## Load Data

```{r}
data <- read_tsv("data/CCES16_Common_OUTPUT_Feb2018_VV2.tab")
```

## Data Manipulation and Graphing

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Variables of Interest: 
## CL_E2016PPEP (Political Party in 2016 Presidential Primary)
data_specific <- data %>%
  select(CL_E2016PPEP, religpew, race, hispanic) %>%
  filter(CL_E2016PPEP == "REP" | CL_E2016PPEP == "DEM")

### Rename REP/DEM to subgroups used in original graph
data_specific <- data_specific %>%
  mutate(CL_E2016PPEP = case_when(
    CL_E2016PPEP == "REP" ~ "Republican primary voters",
    CL_E2016PPEP == "DEM" ~ "Democratic primary voters"))

### Change variable for political party into a factor so graph will be generated with 
### Republican voters on the left every time
data_specific$CL_E2016PPEP <- factor(data_specific$CL_E2016PPEP, 
  levels = c("Republican primary voters", "Democratic primary voters"))

## pid3 (Political Identity) --> ended up not being relevant
## Religion: Christian, Non-Christian/Something Else, No Religious Affiliation
data_specific <- data_specific %>%
  mutate(Religious_Affiliation = case_when(
    religpew == 1 ~ "Christian",
    religpew == 2 ~ "Christian",
    religpew == 3 ~ "Christian",
    religpew == 4 ~ "Christian",
    religpew == 5 ~ "Non-Christian or Something Else",
    religpew == 6 ~ "Non-Christian or Something Else",
    religpew == 7 ~ "Non-Christian or Something Else",
    religpew == 8 ~ "Non-Christian or Something Else",
    religpew == 12 ~ "Non-Christian or Something Else",
    religpew == 11 ~ "No Religious Affiliation",
    TRUE ~ "NA"))
data_specific$Religious_Affiliation <- factor(data_specific$Religious_Affiliation, 
      levels = c("No Religious Affiliation",
                 "Non-Christian or Something Else",
                 "Christian"))

### Realization at this point there isn't a way to break a subgroup down by another 
### variable, so will make another religion variable and break down Christianity 
### specifically by race

## Race/Ethnicity: Black, Hispanic, White, and Other Races
data_specific <- data_specific %>%
  mutate(Racial_Group = case_when(
    race == 1 ~ "White",
    race == 2 ~ "Black",
    race == 3 | hispanic == 1 ~ "Hispanic",
    race == 4 ~ "Other Race",
    race == 5 ~ "Other Race",
    race == 6 ~ "Other Race",
    race == 7 ~ "Other Race")) %>%
  mutate(Christian_Racial_Group = case_when(
    Religious_Affiliation == "Christian" & Racial_Group == "Other Race" ~ "Other Race",
    Religious_Affiliation == "Christian" & Racial_Group == "Hispanic" ~ "Hispanic",
    Religious_Affiliation == "Christian" & Racial_Group == "Black" ~ "Black",
    Religious_Affiliation == "Christian" & Racial_Group == "White" ~ "White",
    Religious_Affiliation == "Non-Christian or Something Else" ~ "Non-Christian or Something Else",
    Religious_Affiliation == "No Religious Affiliation" ~ "No Religious Affiliation",
    TRUE ~ "NA"))

### Ensure order is as appears on original graph
data_specific$Christian_Racial_Group <- factor(data_specific$Christian_Racial_Group, 
      levels = c("No Religious Affiliation",
                 "Non-Christian or Something Else",
                 "Other Race", 
                 "Black", 
                 "Hispanic", 
                 "White"))

# Ended up not needing: data_specific <- data_specific %>% arrange(Christian_Racial_Group)
# %>% group_by(Christian_Racial_Group) %>% mutate(label_y = cumsum())

## Make a Baseline Dataframe
data_baseline <- data_specific %>%
  filter(Religious_Affiliation != "NA") %>% 
  filter(Racial_Group != "NA") %>% 
  filter(Christian_Racial_Group != "NA")

## Investigate Proportion of Each Group
### Create a Table That Calculates Total of Each Party
proportions_data_specific_total <- data_baseline %>%
  arrange(CL_E2016PPEP, rev(Christian_Racial_Group)) %>% 
  group_by(CL_E2016PPEP) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  rename(total = n)

### Calculate Proportions Based on Total of Each Party
proportions_data_specific <- data_baseline %>%
  arrange(CL_E2016PPEP, rev(Christian_Racial_Group)) %>% 
  group_by(CL_E2016PPEP, Christian_Racial_Group) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  left_join(proportions_data_specific_total, by = "CL_E2016PPEP") %>% 
  mutate(Percentage = n/total) %>% group_by(CL_E2016PPEP) %>% 
  mutate(label_y = 1 - (cumsum(Percentage) - 0.5 * Percentage))

# Data Visualization
ggplot(data = proportions_data_specific, 
       aes(x = CL_E2016PPEP, y = Percentage, 
           group = Christian_Racial_Group, 
           fill = Christian_Racial_Group)) + 
  scale_x_discrete(position = "top") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = 
    c(`No Religious Affiliation` = "limegreen",
      `Non-Christian or Something Else` = "purple",
      `Other Race` = "gold", 
      White = "firebrick1", 
      Hispanic = "darkorange", 
      Black = "orange")) + 
  geom_col() + 
  geom_text(aes(y = label_y, label = Christian_Racial_Group), colour = "white") + 
  labs(title = "Democratic voters are less religious and more diverse", 
  subtitle = "Breakdown of 2016 presidential election primary voters by religious affiliation and party (and, among Christians, race)") + 
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), 
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gainsboro"), 
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gainsboro"), 
        legend.position = "none", axis.ticks = element_blank())
```

# Concluding Rationales

I decided to stop here, as I had already spent about 3-4 hours trying to get as close to the original graph as possible. The most difficult part of the exercise for me had been centering the group name exactly at the center of each "stack" in the bar graph. Through this experience, I have learned that even "professional" graphs can take quite a while to make.
