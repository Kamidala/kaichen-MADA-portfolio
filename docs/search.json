    "text": "Short Biography\nI am a Master of Public Health (MPH) student with an emphasis in Epidemiology. I completed my undergraduate education at the University of Georgia (UGA) with a major in Biology before matriculating into the MPH program via the dual degree pathway offered (4+1). As a future public health professional who comes from a multicultural background and speaks three languages, I find the international stage to be very important to ongoing public health topics.\n\nFun Fact\nI very much enjoy foreign language musicals and have met some of my closest friends through a French musical it seems no one has ever heard of: Mozart L’Opera Rock."
